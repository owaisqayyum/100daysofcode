# Day 3

On day 3 i implemented the following small projects. 

1. Treasure finder 
2. Advanced BMI Calculator
3. Love Calculator
4. Pizza Order
5. Leap Year
6. Even or Odd number. 

while implementing these projects i learnt about conditional 
statements, nested conditional statements. if-elif statements, 
conditional operators, conversion from uppercase to lower case and 
counting number of times a char occured in a string.
